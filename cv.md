Hello! My name is Anton. In 2017 I finished Belarus National Technical University (Faculty of Management Technologies and Humanitarization). From these courses I want to get as much knowledge as possible. I would like to become a master in one of the JS frameworks (maybe both :)), I would like to get deep knowledge of GIT, because I want to learn how to work in a team and as a result I really want to get a job as a web developer.

On that moment I have experience with **JS, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Styled Components**, and I familiar with few important **GIT** commands.
Examples of my code you can see on my GitHub and CodeWars pages.

As language online test said, my English level is A2 - B1. I can read news, some articles, docs. Also I can watch some videos and listens podcasts.
Thanks for your attention.
